# Pegasus Constituent Management System (PCMS)
This project is being undertaken as I am learning Python and wanted a project where I could practise my coding skills.

## Introduction
This repository houses the files and necessary documentation for the Pegasus Constituent Management System (PCMS). PCMS will allow parliamentarians to record and store interactions with their constituents. This will have many benefits which include better constituent engagement, issues tracking and better communication. 

### File Structure
The packages will be broken up into a number of subsystems. These include: 
- Backend (Software that interacts with the SQL backend)
- Frontend (The GUI)
- Documentation (All relevent documentation lives here)

### To Do List
- [] Create GUI
- [] Create backend SQL interface software
- [] Testing 
- [] Create user documentation
